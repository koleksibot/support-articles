<p>If you cannot find your organization in the list (from "Choose an organization"), <strong>you may need to follow at least one project for the organization</strong> - this is not related to the permission settings of the project within your VCS, but the matter of CircleCI permission. Please make sure you are following projects here: https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/&lt;vcs (github/bitbucket)&gt;/&lt;org-name&gt;/</p>
<p><em>Following </em>a project enables a user to subscribe to <em><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/notifications/">email notifications</a> for the project <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/status/">build status</a> and adds the project to their CircleCI dashboard. </em>(Reference: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/projects/#add-projects-page">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/projects/#add-projects-page</a>)</p>
