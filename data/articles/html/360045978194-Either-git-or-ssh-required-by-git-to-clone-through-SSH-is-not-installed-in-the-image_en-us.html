<p>If you receive this error message while building with a custom image on CircleCI, it is because Git and SSH are required for CircleCI to work properly. If SSH and Git are missing from the container, the build agent will fall back to the native Git client, which may cause some issues. To resolve this error, install Git and SSH to the Docker image.</p>
<p>If you receive this error on a CircleCI convenience image, please contact Support for assistance.</p>
