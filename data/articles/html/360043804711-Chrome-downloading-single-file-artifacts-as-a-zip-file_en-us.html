<p dir="auto">For security purposes we have found that Chrome will sometimes download a single file as a zipped file, usually when the file format is a mobile app -- i.e. <code>.ipa</code> or <code>.aab</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You have a few options to get around this and get the file itself:</p>
<ol dir="auto" type="1">
    <li>You can utilize another browser besides Chrome, like Safari or Firefox.</li>
    <li>You can simply rename the file once downloaded from Chrome to have a <code>.ipa</code> or <code>.aab</code> file extension.</li>
    <li>You can right-click, then choose "Save link as", then when it prompts you -- change the format from "Zip" to "All files" and edit the filename to have the proper extension.</li>
    <li>A bit more involved, but you could specifically set the MIME type of the file within your job steps: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes" rel="noreferrer">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes</a> -- this should ensure the browser respects the type of file it is.</li>
