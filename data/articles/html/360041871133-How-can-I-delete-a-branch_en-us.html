<p>CircleCI automatically deletes branches when we receive a branch deletion event from your VCS provider (GitHub / Bitbucket).</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If you attempt to delete a branch while a job connected to that branch is still running, the branch will be re-created in CircleCI when the job is finished. Please allow all jobs running on a branch to finish before deleting it from the VCS provider to assure it will stay deleted. </p>
