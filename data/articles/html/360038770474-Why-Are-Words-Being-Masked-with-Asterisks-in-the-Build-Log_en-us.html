<p>We recently rolled out the secret masking feature to help keep environment variables private and this feature will automatically mask environment variables that are written to the build log.</p>
<p>For more information on how this works, please see the following article:Â <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/keep-environment-variables-private-with-secret-masking/" target="_self">Keep environment variables private with secret masking</a></p>
<p>The support team is able to disable this feature on a per-project basis. An org admin can open a <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us" target="_self">support ticket</a> to request this action to be taken.</p>
