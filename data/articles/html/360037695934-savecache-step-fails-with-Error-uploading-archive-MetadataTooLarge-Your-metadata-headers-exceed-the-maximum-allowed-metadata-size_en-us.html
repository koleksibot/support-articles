<p>When too many paths are specified to the <strong>save_cache</strong> step, the <strong>save_cache</strong> step can fail with error output similar to the following:</p>
<pre>Creating cache archive...<br>Uploading cache archive...<br><br>Error uploading archive: MetadataTooLarge: Your metadata headers exceed the maximum allowed metadata size<br>status code: 400, request id: 519C2A1181266E40, host id: A/Ahq11R30q0fAEEaZoUyPnGQgTmrQH3GwprdI0+iaRbAFkwYHDNedpPZ3gFOLUnvAgB28c5954=</pre>
<p>This is due to a limitation with the size of the metadata associated with the cache, as the paths form a part of the metadata. To resolve the error, reduce the number of paths specified to the <strong>save_cache</strong> step, for example, by splitting the step into multiple <strong>save_cache</strong> steps.</p>
