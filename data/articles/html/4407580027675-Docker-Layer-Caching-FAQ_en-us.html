<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Layer Caching (DLC)</a> can reduce Docker image build times on CircleCI by caching individual layers of any Docker images built as part of your jobs. Here are some frequently asked questions around DLC:</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC available between different workflows under the same project?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">Yes, DLC is not locked to workflows or jobs. You can create a maximum of 50 DLC volumes per project (including any parallelism).</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Why are subsequent builds not able to access the cache consistently?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">If a job fails while calling a specific DLC volume, it would require rebuilding when calling it again, causing inconsistencies. It is worth noting that different jobs may also use different volumes. An example being if two<span> </span><code>machine</code><span> </span>jobs are run in parallel, they <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#how-dlc-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will get different DLC volumes</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>How can I delete my DLC cache instance?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">DLC caches are immutable, so they cannot be selectively deleted. However, a cache will be deleted after 3 days of not being used in a project.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC guaranteed? </strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">DLC is not guaranteed. <span>If you are experiencing issues with cache-misses or need high-parallelism, consider try caching using <code><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-external-cache-sources">docker build</a></code>, which you can optionally implement using the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker#commands-build">CircleCI Docker orb</a></span>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>As an admin, can I see the content of a DLC volume?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">While you can see what volume is used for each job, at this time, the content is unavailable.</p>
