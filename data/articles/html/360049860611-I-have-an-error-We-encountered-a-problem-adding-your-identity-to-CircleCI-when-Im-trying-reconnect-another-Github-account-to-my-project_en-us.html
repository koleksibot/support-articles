<p>If you encounter this error when authorizing another GitHub or BitBucket account to your CircleCI account, this means that the account has already been authorized with CircleCI. This can be solved by revoking CircleCI's OAuth token within your VCS account, and attempting to authorize again.</p>
<p>If you still are unable to connect your VCS account, please <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_self">submit a new request</a> and we will manually disconnect your VCS account for you.</p>
