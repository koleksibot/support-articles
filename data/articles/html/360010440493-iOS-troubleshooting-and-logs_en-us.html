<div>CircleCI is configured to capture many logs from iOS builds, such as from Gym and Scan. To save these as an artifact to help with troubleshooting, you can set the environment variable <code>FL_OUTPUT_DIR</code> is the artifact directory. Use this to set the path in the <code>store_artifacts</code> step to automatically save logs such as Gym and Scan.</div>
