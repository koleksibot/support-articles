<p>A recent change in the way the config location of modules is decided in the upstream PHP images can result in the error message in the title.</p>
<p>The config location is decided by the environment variable "PHP_INI_DIR", which is set as part of the image's environment.</p>
<p>If using sudo to enable config, the necessary environment variable is stripped before the command is run, resulting in config going to the wrong place.</p>
<p>To get things to work as they did before, you can add the -E flag to the sudo command to have it preserve the environment.</p>
<p>Old config:</p>
<pre>sudo docker-php-ext-install mcryptÂ </pre>
<p>New config:</p>
<pre>sudo -E docker-php-ext-install mcrypt</pre>
