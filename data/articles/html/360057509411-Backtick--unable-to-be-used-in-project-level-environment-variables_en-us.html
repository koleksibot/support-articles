<p>If the value you need to store in an environment variable contains a backtick (i.e. <code>`</code>) you will not be able to store it as a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project-level environment variable</a>. However, you can store the variable and value instead at either the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context level</a> or within the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job itself</a>. One note is that storing it at the job level is not secure and will expose the value within your configuration file.</p>
