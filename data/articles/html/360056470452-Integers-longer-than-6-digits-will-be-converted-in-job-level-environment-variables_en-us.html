<p>When setting a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job level environment variable</a>, if the value is an integer and greater than 6 digits, we will convert it to an exponential number. As an example:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
    environment:
      NUMBER: 7777777</pre>
<p>The above would become instead <code>7.777777e+06</code> in the job. The reason for this conversion is how yaml interprets the value being passed. However, this can be avoided in a few different ways.</p>
<h2>Store value as a string</h2>
<p>Instead of setting the value as an integer instead set it as a string. So instead of <code>7777777</code> set it to <code>"7777777"</code> like this:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
    environment:
      NUMBER: "7777777"</pre>
<h2>Set the variable at the project level</h2>
<p>Instead of setting the variable in your <code>config.yml</code> directly, you can instead <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set the variable at the project level</a> to utilize in jobs. This will ensure the value is protected and not automatically converted.</p>
