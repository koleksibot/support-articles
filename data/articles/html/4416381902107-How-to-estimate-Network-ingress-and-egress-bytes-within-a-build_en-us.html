<p>You can view d<span>etails of your organization's network transfer and storage usage on your Plan &gt; Plan Usage screen. In addition, you can <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/persist-data/#managing-network-and-storage-use" target="_self">find out more about how to manage your network and storage costs here</a>.</span><br><br>However, you may like to determine the network transfer (ingress and egress) of a specific build. This may be useful for your team, in order to diagnose which processes in the build may be consuming high network transfer usage for instance.<br><br>For Docker-based jobs, we can look at the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html#id15" target="_self">networking information, particularly from `/proc/net/dev`</a>, to figure out the network transfer, before and after a specific command.</p>
<pre>cat /proc/net/dev</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Extending on the method above, <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nanophate/docker-profiling" target="_self">here is an example Orb that will calculate the stats to readable format</a>. We can see it in action with an example screenshot below:</p>

<p>To illustrate how to use <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nanophate/docker-profiling#commands-network" target="_self">the `network` command of this Orb</a>, you can configure your config like this, to see how much bytes are transmitted and received for a `curl` request, for example:</p>
<pre><span class="hljs-attr">version:</span><span> </span><span>'2.1'<br></span><br><span class="hljs-attr">orbs:<br></span><span class="hljs-attr">  profiling:</span> nanophate/docker-profiling@0.3.0<br><br>jobs:<br><span>  build</span>:<br>    docker:<br>      - image: cimg/base:stable<br>  steps:<br>    <span>- checkout<br></span><span>    - profiling/network</span><br><br></pre>
<p><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your overall <strong>Network Transfer</strong> amount is not representative of your billable usage. Only certain actions will result in network egress, which in turn results in billable usage.
