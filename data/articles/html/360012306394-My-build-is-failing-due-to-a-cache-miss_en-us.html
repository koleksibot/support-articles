<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching">Caching</a> is a good strategy for optimizing jobs on CircleCI as it enables the reusing the data from expensive fetch operations from previous jobs. However, cache hits are not guaranteed; caches created via the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#save_cache">save_cache</a> step are only stored for up to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/#managing-caches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 days</a>.</p>
<p>Hence if you're writing your jobs in a way that they fail or do the wrong thing when there's a cache miss, consider improving them to be resilient to a cache miss. For example, a job that makes use of cached dependencies should be written such that it would be able to do a fresh fetch of the required dependencies upon a cache miss, instead of failing.</p>
