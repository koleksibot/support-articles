<p>If your build produces persistent artifacts such as screenshots, coverage reports, core files, or deployment tarballs, CircleCI can provide a link to download them. You can find them on the 'Artifacts' tab:<img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360081971392/artifacts.png" alt="artifacts.png"></p>
<p>The documentation for using artifacts is here: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/</a></p>
<p>Artifacts will be available for up-to 30 days. If you're relying on them as a source of documentation / persistent content, we recommend deploying the output to a dedicated output target, such as <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_self">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_self">Netlify</a> for static websites.</p>
