<p>When submitting a Support ticket for the private installation of CircleCI, you may be asked to provide a support bundle. Usually, this can be downloaded from the "Support" tab in the Management Console.</p>
<p>In cases where this is unsuccessful, you can manually create a support bundle with the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>SSH into the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/overview/#services-machine" target="_self">Services machine</a>
    </li>
    <li>To obtain the app id for CircleCI run: <code>sudo replicated apps</code>
    </li>
    <li>To download the support bundle: <code>sudo replicated support-bundle [app-id]</code>
    </li>
</ol>
