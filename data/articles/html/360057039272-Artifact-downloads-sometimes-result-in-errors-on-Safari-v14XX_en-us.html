<p>Occasionally when you attempt to download an artifact from the UI in Safari (any version 14) you will<span> receive a file called "fetch-nonce.txt" which will contain text "You must be logged in".</span></p>
<p><span>There are a few workarounds for this:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span>Utilize a different browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to download the artifacts</span></li>
    <li><span>Visit the artifact (click it, it will open in a new tab) and then right click the page and use the "Save page source" option to save the file.</span></li>
</ol>
