<p>Windows Powershell doesn't have <code>sudo</code> - some commands needs to be run as an administrator  Powershell has no concept of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One solution we can use is <code>Start-Process</code> command: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process</a> The following line is the example of this command.</p>
<pre>Start-Process wpr -verb runAs -Args "-start GeneralProfile"</pre>
<p>This is calling <code>wpr</code> (Windows Performance Recorder) as an administrator and passing necessary arguments with <code>-Args</code> flag.  However in this case, the challenge is that we don't see the output because theoretically, since it starts a new shell somewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other way you can think is scoop (<a href="https://scoop.sh/">https://scoop.sh/</a>) which enables the commands equivalent to the one in Linux. You can install by following way:</p>
<pre>iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')<br>set-executionpolicy unrestricted -s cu -f<br>scoop install sudo</pre>
<p>By installing this, you can use <code>sudo</code> just like you're in Linux. However with this, it's basically doing the same thing with the above so it's not possible to see the output anyway.
