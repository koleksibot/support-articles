<p>Generally speaking, Orbs will have their source code available on GitHub or another git hosting service, which will be linked from the registry page. Not all Orbs are written and maintained by CircleCI, so getting involved with the Orb's own repository is recommended and encouraged!</p>
<p>If the source link is not available, feel free to open a ticket so we can either get in touch with the original author or provide a link to the repository.</p>
