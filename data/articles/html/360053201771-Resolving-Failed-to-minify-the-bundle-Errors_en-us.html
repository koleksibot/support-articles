<p>The following error message is usually related to running out of memory during a job:</p>
<pre class="css-1hjuxmj"><code style="white-space: pre !important;">Failed to minify the bundle. Error: static/js/12.fb78ba11.chunk.js from Terser
Error: Call retries were exceeded</code></pre>
<p>Webpack4 starts using<span> </span><code>terser-webpack-plugin</code> to minify your JavaScript as default. The default parallel option in<span> </span><code>terser-webpack-plugin</code><span> </span>is set to the number of CPUs<span> </span><code>(os.cpus().length - 1)</code>. It means the function references the actual VM's CPU count, and it's a bigger number of CPUs than the docker executor has. Therefore, Webpack will make more workers than the vCPU counts, and it causes this error.</p>
<p dir="auto"><br>To work around this, you will need to specify the parallel option to set to the same number as the vCPUs. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript" style="white-space: pre !important;">const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        parallel: 2,
      }),
    ],
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p dir="auto">Also, if your project created by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_self">create-react-app</a>, it needs to use `<span>eject` or `react-app-rewired` to update webpack configuration.</span></p>

<p>If it doesn't solve the problem, there are a couple of options you can try:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increase the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker-executor" target="_self">resource class</a> in use to provide more memory to the job</li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009208393-How-can-I-increase-the-max-memory-for-Node-" target="_self">Adjust the "max_old_space_size" for NodeJS to a suitable value</a>. For example, if you are using the medium resource class with 4GB of memory, then set this to 3GB.
    </li>
</ul>
