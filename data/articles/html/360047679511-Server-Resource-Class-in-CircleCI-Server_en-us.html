<p><strong>Note: </strong>This information is for our self-hosted server product and is unrelated to CircleCI cloud</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CircleCI server customers can use any <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource class</a> they want without any restrictions or approval since they are using their infrastructure. </p>
<p>Customers can also customize resource classes for their installation to provide developers with CPU/RAM options for the Jobs they configure. Check <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/customizations/#resource-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document</a> to know how to customize the resource class.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Container size (resources) cannot be more than that of the underlying nomad clients. In such a situation, that particular job will always just remain queued. </p>
<p>If you are getting an error while using the resource class feature, please submit a ticket to <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us" target="_self">Support</a> or write to <a href="mailto:support@circleci.com">support@circleci.com</a>.</p>
