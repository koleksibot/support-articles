<p>The fastest way to receive support for an issue with a CircleCI convenience image is to file an issue over on the CircleCI images repository here:Â <a href="https://github.com/circleci/circleci-images/issues">https://github.com/circleci/circleci-images/issues</a></p>
<p>Our Community Partner Engineers, who are responsible for creating and maintaining the CircleCI convenience images will then be able to work with you directly on resolving the issue.</p>
<p>If you have not received a response on your issue, or the problem is more complex than a bug/issue with the CircleCI image, please open a support ticket for further assistance.</p>
