<p>The maximum number of variables that are configurable for one context is limited to 100 variables. Contexts created prior to this limit being introduced will still be allowed to have more than 100 variables, but new ones will not be able to be added until the total number is lower than 100.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can create additional contexts for new variables, and then include multiple contexts in your builds.</p>
<p>Also, it is now possible to modify the values of variables directly using the context endpoints of our <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/addEnvironmentVariableToContext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V2 API</a></p>
