<pre>-
Beginning November 1, 2020, [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) has enabled rate limits based on the originating
IP address. Since CircleCI runs jobs from a shared pool of IPs, it is strongly
recommended to use authenticated Docker pulls with Docker Hub to avoid encountering
rate limits.

Identifying this error can be done by examining the `Spin Up Environment` step
of your build output for a `toomanyrequests:Too Many Requests` error message.

**Solutions:** 
Using authentication for Docker Hub in your builds is the best way to avoid being rate limited for Docker image Pulls.
The first suggestion is to create a [Context](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/) for your Docker Hub credentials to encorporate in your `config.yml`.

Example config:

You may also use a per-project Environment Variables as shown here.

Alternative soltuions can also be found here in our [Documentation here.](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images) 

Below is an example of a build failure due to encountering the Docker
rate limit.
