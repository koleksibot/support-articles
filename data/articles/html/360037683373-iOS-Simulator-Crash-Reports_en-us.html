<p>If your iOS app crashes in the Simulator during a test run, the crash report can be used for diagnosing the exact cause of the crash.</p>
<p>By default, the crash reports for the app will be written to the ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports directory.</p>
<p>The crash reports can be uploaded as artifacts to assist with debugging the app crash on your local machine:</p>
<pre>- store_artifacts:<br>    path: ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</pre>
