<p>The macOS executor offers two <code>resource_class</code> levels:</p>
<p>- Medium: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM</p>
<p>- Large*: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM</p>
<p>*<em>This resource size requires review by our account team. Feel free to open a support ticket if you would like to request access</em></p>
<p>Additional details and how to set a <code>resource_class</code> can be found in our <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#macos-executor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">configuration documentation.</a></p>
<p>Disk space is not dependent on the <code>resource_class</code> size and is instead affected by the Xcode version you are using. You can view the available disk space per version within our <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/testing-ios/#supported-xcode-versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xcode version documentation</a>. Click the "Installed Software" link on the version you are using to get specifications. </p>
