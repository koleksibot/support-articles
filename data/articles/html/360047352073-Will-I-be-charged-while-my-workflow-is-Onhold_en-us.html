<p>You will not be charged for workflows that are in a hold state waiting for manual approval. Since the hold state doesn't require any resources, there is no charge. More information on credit charges can be found on our <a href="https://circleci.com/pricing/" target="_self">pricing page</a> -- in addition, we have some further <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>One note to the above is that if you had jobs that ran before the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval step</a> those jobs would have consumed credits to run. However, while the workflow is in an "On-hold" state, it doesn't consume credits.</p>
