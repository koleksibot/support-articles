<p>If you need to change how the checkout step retrieves your code you'll need to perform raw git commands <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using a run step</a>. From there you can customize the checkout process to suit your needs. Remember to remove the convenience <strong>checkout </strong>if adding your own custom <strong>run</strong> step checkout.</p>
