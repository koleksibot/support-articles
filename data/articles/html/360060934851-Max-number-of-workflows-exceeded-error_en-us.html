<p>CircleCI Dynamic Configs, formally known as Setup Workflows, allows for a maximum of 1 workflows in the initial setup workflow. So if `setup: true` is set then the following config would be invalid:<br><br></p>
<pre>workflows:
  one:
    jobs:
      - unit-tests
  two:
    jobs:
      - integration-tests
  </pre>
<p>Customers can work around this by trying to combine both workflows into a single workflow:</p>
<pre>workflows:
  one:
    jobs:
      - unit-tests
      - inegration-tests</pre>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: More than one workflow can be defined within a dynamic config, and the above error can be avoided as long as conditional parameters are set so that only one workflow will be executed.</p>
