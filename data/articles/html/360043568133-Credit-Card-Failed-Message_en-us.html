<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A failed credit card transaction could be due to insufficient funds, an expired or cancelled card, or the bank declining the charge for some other reason. </span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were insufficient funds, please increase the limit on the card. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is expired or cancelled, update the card in your billing portal by clicking on the “Manage Billing and Statements” button on your Plan overview page and click <strong>“Update Payment Method.”</strong> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charge will automatically retry when you update the card on file. If you take action for the card that does not include updating the credit card on file, open a support ticket to request the retry, or wait 1-2 days for it to retry automatically. </span></p>
