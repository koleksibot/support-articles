<p>A <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/jobs-steps/)" target="_self">job</a> is what runs your build process on CircleCI 2.0. It is essentially a series of steps that runs in an execution environment. Jobs are defined in your CircleCI 2.0 <code>config.yml</code>.</p>
<p>At the very minimum, your job needs to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have an executor defined</a>, and at least one step. Typically your job will <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first check out your repository</a> using the special <strong>checkout</strong> step. Then, <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using run steps</a>, you can execute bash commands to perform your building, testing, and deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using workflows</a>, you can define multiple jobs that run in a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#sequential-job-execution-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific sequence</a>, in parallel, and <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#sequential-job-execution-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various other nifty configurations</a>. </p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of special steps you can use to speed up your jobs or add other functionality to your build process. You can try <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#save_cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using cached dependencies</a>, saving <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_artifacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artifacts you've created in your jobs</a>, or even <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_test_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saving your test reports</a> to see how your tests performed right on the job page UI.</p>
<p>While you're waiting for your jobs to complete take a scroll through all of the step options <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on the docs page</a>.</p>
