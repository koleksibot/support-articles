<p>CircleCI supports running the Android emulator through our new Android machine image that supports x86 Android emulator tests and nested virtualization. Documentation on how to access it is available here: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/android-machine-image/" target="_self">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/android-machine-image/</a>. We also recommend using the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/android" target="_self">circleci/android</a> orb in your config as it provides useful commands for emulator testing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: The Android machine image is different from the Android docker convenience images, which do not support emulators</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Common causes of failed UI tests when using the emulator on Android machine image</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Insufficient memory</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using at least a resource class of at least "large" and above, as "medium" is usually insufficient to run the emulator and gradle processes.</p>
<p><strong>- Emulator configuration</strong></p>
<p>Higher API levels and/or system images that come with Google APIs installed have been observed to be less stable, or require specific emulator options (e.g. no-window to be enabled/disabled). If UI tests are failing, we recommend trying out <em>both</em> system images "<span>system-images;android-29;default;x86" and "system-images;android-29;default;x86_64" to see if the tests will pass with either, as these 2 system images are observed to be relatively more stable.</span></p>
<p><span>Certain tests may also require emulator capabilities, e.g. Google/Playstore APIs, or the camera, to be present.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>- Emulator animations</strong></span></p>
<p>We recommend disabling of emulator animations to prevent interference with tests. This can be done through this orb command, <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/android#commands-disable-animations" target="_self">disable-animations</a> , or other commands from the orb that wrap it.</p>
<p><strong>- Flakiness</strong></p>
<p>Some degree of flakiness may be expected from the emulator. We recommend using our android orb command, <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/android#commands-run-tests" target="_self" rel="undefined">run-tests</a>, (or other commands from the orb that wrap it, like <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/android#commands-start-emulator-and-run-tests" target="_self">start-emulator-and-run-tests</a>) to run your tests with, as it supports retries</p>
