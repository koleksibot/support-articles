<p><span>It is not possible to have a config split across multiple files as CircleCI requires a single config file in </span><code>.circleci/config.yml</code><span> to start running.</span></p>
<p><span>While there are examples of split configs in some open source project, such as our Orbs, this is generally just to make them more human-readable. Before these can be used the config must be <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#packing-a-config" target="_self">packed with the CLI</a> - this creates a single config.yml file which can be used with CircleCI.</span></p>
<p>This packing procedure cannot be run as a "pre" step on CircleCI itself as it<span> is not possible to run arbitrary commands before a workflow. Additionally, the workflow itself will not be generated if a valid "whole" config is not found. Config packing must be run locally, with the resulting file checked in to your repo.</span></p>
