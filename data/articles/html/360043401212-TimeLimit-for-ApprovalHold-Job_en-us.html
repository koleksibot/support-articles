<p>Approval/hold jobs have a 90 day limit on when they can be approved. While after 90 days they can't be approved, workflows will remain on-hold until canceled, we don't automatically transition an on-hold workflow out of it's current state.</p>
<p><strong>The only caveat</strong> to the above is jobs that utilize <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/persist-data/#using-workspaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workspaces.</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> If the job <em>after</em> the hold job utilizes a persisted workspace, there is a 15-day limit before the workspace expires. So while the approval job can still be approved up to 90 days, the workspace will not be available and the subsequent jobs will fail.</span></p>
