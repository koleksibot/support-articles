<h3><strong>I’m having trouble logging in to my account</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CircleCI uses Oauth login via your VCS provider (GitHub or Bitbucket). If you mistakenly logged in with a different account, contact <a href="mailto:support@circleci.com">support@circleci.com</a> so they can manually unlink your accounts. If you meant to merge accounts, you can read more here: <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008766354" target="_self">How to merge your CircleCI accounts</a>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How do I create an account for my organization then add developers to it</strong></h3>
