<p>Each build on CircleCI will be allocated specific vCPUs and memory, based on the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/" target="_self">executor type</a> selected.<br><br>We have since <a href="https://circleci.com/changelog/#docker-resource-utilization-graphs" target="_self">released the Resources tab</a> on the build UI for builds using the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-intro/#docker" target="_self">Docker executor</a>.<br>This will allow developers to understand the CPU and memory utilization profile of their <strong>Docker-executor</strong> builds, especially if they are under-provisioned (or over-provisioned for that matter).<br><br><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/4418633793563/circleci-circleci-docs-example.png" alt="circleci-circleci-docs-example.png"><br><br><strong>Note</strong>Â that for Docker-executor jobs that <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-multiple-docker-images" target="_self">uses multiple images</a>, note that this graph accounts for <strong>all of the containers, </strong>not just the primary container.<br>In addition, the data points are captured at 15-seconds intervals, so if your job completes before 15 seconds, there would be no data points on the graph then.<br><br>You can then provision a larger <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#available-docker-resource-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource class</a> to allocate resources accordingly.<br><br></p>
