<p><span>CircleCI Server 2.x does not yet support orbs natively. However, if you process your config prior to committing, orbs can be translated and used.</span></p>
<p><span>The following workaround brings Orbs on CircleCI Server 2.x and mimics the flow that occurs in CircleCI’s Cloud Product. In its most simplistic form, this workaround takes a version 2.1 configuration files and translates them into a version 2.0</span></p>
<p>You can learn more about this workaround here: <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/orbs-on-server-solution/36264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discuss.circleci.com/t/orbs-on-server-solution/36264</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Orbs are now available on Server 3.x</strong> and Server 3.x installations include their own local orb registry. This registry is private to the server installation.</p>
<p>All orbs referenced in configs reference the orbs in the server orb registry. You are responsible for maintaining orbs; this includes copying orbs from the public registry, updating orbs that may have been copied prior, and registering your companies private orbs if they exist.</p>
<p>More information on how to manage, list, import public orb, etc. can be found here: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-operator-orbs/?section=server-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-operator-orbs/?section=server-administration</a></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To manage orbs,  <span>CircleCI user must be an admin.</span></p>
