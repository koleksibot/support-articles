<p>Some users using the aws-ecr orb are experiencing failed builds when installing the AWS CLI, resulting in the following error:</p>
<pre class="css-1hjuxmj">RequirementParseError: Expected ',' or end-of-list in rsa&gt;=3.1.2,&lt;=4.5.0; python_version=="2.7" at ; python_version=="2.7"
<span class="ansi-yellow ansi-yellow ">You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 21.0.1 is available.</span>
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.</pre>
<p>This is due to an updated AWS CLI package changing requirements for Python / pip.</p>
<p>It's possible to resolve this issue by requesting a more recent version of the aws-ecr orb:</p>
